Genesis is a command-line tool to create new Python projects.

When invoked, it copies files and directories from a project template,
doing several search-and-replace operations on the copied files to insert
your project's name, the project author's name, etc.

One default project template is provided built-in to Genesis, but you can
also supply your own.

Note that this README describes some features which are not yet implemented.
See 'Known Issues' below.


Dependencies
------------

  * Tested on Ubuntu and Windows XP
  * Python 3.2


Usage
-----

::

    genesis [<options>] <projectname> [<name>=<value>...]

This creates a directory named *projectname*, if it doesn't already exist,
containing your new project. <Options> may include any of:

    --template=T
        Template to use. T defaults to 'default'. Valid values are the name of
        any template directory stored within your '~/.genesis' directory.
    --license=L
        Uses license file 'L' from ~/.genesis/licenses. Also useful as a
        template tag: ``G{license}`` anywhere else in your template will be
        replaced with the name of your license.
    --force
        Required to create a new project in a non-empty directory, overwriting
        any files or dirs with the same name as template content.
    --config-dir=C
        Use C as your config dir instead of ~/.genesis. Used for testing
        Genesis itself during development.

All of the above also define name-value pairs which are used to search-and-
replace tags within the copied template. For example, a tag in the template
of the form 'G{template}' will be replaced by the value of the template
argument in the output files.

In addition, the command line can include any number of space-separated
``name=value`` pairs, which are also used to search-and-replace tags in the
template.

For example, ``author_email=me@example.com`` on the command-line will cause
``G{author_email}`` anywhere in the template to be replaced with
'me@example.com' in the created project.

``<Projectname>`` should not contain any equals characters - this is the only
feature that distinguishes it from ``name=value`` pairs.


Undefined tag values
--------------------

If the template contains any ``G{name}`` tags which do not have a value defined
on the command-line nor in the config file, then a warning 'Undefined tags
in template' will be issued.

The project that is created will still have the named ``G{}`` tags in it.
To fix this, you can simply search for these tags and replace them manually.
Alternatively, re-run Genesis with a name=value pair added to the command-line
for each of the undefined tags. Better still would be to define the tags
permanently in your config file, so they will not cause the same problem
in future.

Regardless, if you end up re-running Genesis to regenerate the project, then
you will either have to delete the one that was just created, or use the
``--force`` command-line flag, so that Genesis overwrites the previously
generated project.


Config file
-----------

The config file, ``~/.genesis/genesis.config``, is a Python 3.2 syntax file,
although it has no .py extension. In it values can be assigned to variables
which behave just like flags or name-value pairs on the command-line. For
example, a config file might contain::

    template = 'my_favourite'
    author = 'Jonathan Hartley'
    
This is equivalent to specifying
``--template=my_favourite author=Jonathan\ Hartley`` on the command-line.

Values in the config file are overridden by the command-line.

If your template contains tags with names which are not valid Python variable
names, you will not be able to specify those tags' values in the config file.


The Default Project Template
----------------------------

Projects created by Genesis 'default' template support the following:

**Create a source distribution**

::

    python setup.py sdist

This uses the first paragraph from your README as your project's
description, and the remainder of the README as the long_description. The
Cheese Shop expects these to be in RestructuredText format like this README
is.

**Register on The Cheese Shop (PyPI)**

::

    python setup.py register

**Upload source distribution to the Cheese Shop (PyPI)**

::

    python setup.py sdist register upload

**Create a Windows binary**

::

    python setup.py py2exe

**Makefile**

A Makefile is created to abbreviate the above commands (make sdist, etc), and
also supports the following targets:

  clean
    Deletes .pyo .pyc, tags. Requires ctags to be on the path.
  profile
    Requires RunSnakeRun, see Makefile for details.

The Makefile can be used on Windows by having Cygwin binaries on your PATH.


Defining your own templates
---------------------------

Create a directory under ``~/.genesis``. Fill it with the files and directories
you'd like to start your project with. Insert tags into the template files
of the form ``G{name}``. Now you can create a new project using this template
using::

    genesis --template <mytemplate> <projectname>

Where ``<mytemplate>`` is the name of the directory you created. To make this
type of template the default, add a line to your config file::

    template = '<mytemplate>'

Now you need only issue the command-line::

    genesis <projectname>


Known Issues
------------

Undefined tags should be reported to the user.

--license not implemented. Assumes your project is BSD license.
Should barf on unknown license choices. User should be able to add own
licenses.
Implementation suggestion: G{license_text} should be automatically generated
from choice of --license. Genesis should provide the text of various well-known
licenses.
Alternative implementation: Before search-and-replace, we choose a license file
based on --license.

Auto generated tags: G{year}, G{date}

Not actually tested on Ubuntu

No binaries are available, which makes Genesis unusable unless you you have
Python 3.2 foremost on your path.

Not for v1 release:
...................

Default template setup.py does not put data_files into the manifest.in

Don't know what to use for project url:
Explicit G{url} tag requires setting on command line for every project, or else
using a wrong default value.
Alternative is to try and be clever::
    url='G{github_equiv}/G{username}/G{name}',
But presumably this pattern is not applicable to many projects.
How about the not-quite-as clever::
    url='G{url_root}/G{name}',
Final alternative is to leave blank. :-(

Should allow user to interactively supply values for undefined tags.

Default template should include documentation.

Doesn't preserve permissions on template files.

Sdist contains a dist directory. Is this required? (Simply do a make clean
before make sdist?)

The config file is parsed using 'eval'. I'm not smart enough to know whether
this is a security problem.

The modest contents of this directory owe much to Tarek Ziad√©'s highly
recommended book `Expert Python Programming`, which improved the way I work
with Python every day.
